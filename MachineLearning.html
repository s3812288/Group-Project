        <!--What does it do? (600 words) ​What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?
-->
    <li1><strong><ins>What does it do ?</ins></strong></li1>
    <p>According to the definition of Expert System website, machine learning is a small area of computer science and it is able to learn things based on the given data without programming detailed instruction. The machine starts by testing something smaller and using statistical algorithms to see how the data fits together. It will test the outcome and see if it is correct by comparing it to the training data. Everytime the machine learns something new, the data will be stored in the database. Therefore, it will improve and adapt.</p>
    <p>It is hard to know which is the state of art of machine learning since each algorithm has its role in solving the problems. Therefore, I will list some well performing algorithms and how can we use it:</p>
        <dt>- Naive Bayes:</dt>
    <img src="http://uc-r.github.io/public/images/analytics/naive_bayes/naive_bayes_icon.png" alt="algorithms">
        <dd><li><p>According to Wikipedia, Naive Bayes is an algorithm that is commonly used in machine learning based on Bayes’s theorem. It is used to achieve higher accuracy prediction depending on the training data. The strength of using Naive Bayes is that it only needs a small number of training data to evaluate important parament for classification.</p></li></dd>
        <dd><li><p>Naive Bayes can be used in real time prediction, multi class prediction, text classification/ spam filtering/ sentiment analysis, recommendation system, etc.</p></li></dd>
        <dt>- Decision tree:</dt>
    <img src="http://www.xoriant.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Decision-Trees-modified-1.png" alt="algorithms">
        <dd><li><p>According to Wikipedia, Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning which has a tree-looking flowchart structure and contains conditional statements (if, else if, else). Moreover, it can be used in both classification (more common) and regression.</p></li></dd>
        <dd><li><p>Decision Tree has been applied in Banking Finance to classify customers into 3 types: good, average, bad based on their credit record.</p></li></dd>
        <dt>- Random forest:</dt>
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*i0o8mjFfCn-uD79-F1Cqkw.png" alt="algorithms">
        <dd><li><p>Random forest and decision tree have the same concept but it is slightly different. If a decision tree is built on an entire dataset, using all the features/variables of interest.  A random forest, in the other hand, randomly selects observations/rows and specific features/variables to build multiple decision trees from and then averages the results.</p></li></dd>
        <dd><li><p>According to Wikipedia, Random forest contains many decision trees and combines them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.</p></li></dd>
        <dt>- Ada Boots:</dt>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BoGNyWW9-mE/maxresdefault.jpg" width=700 height=400 alt="algorithms">
        <dd><li><p>According to Wikipedia, AdaBoost is used as a boost algorithm developed for binary classification. It makes the short decision tree have good performance by accounting for the incorrectly classified examples in the training set.</p></li></dd>
        <dt>- Support Vector Machine:</dt>
    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*06GSco3ItM3gwW2scY6Tmg.png" width=700 height=350 alt="algorithms">
          <dd><li><p>According to Wikipedia, generally, the support vector machine is to find the best hyperland that is given the maximum margin from both tags. Therefore, this can be called as <strong>Maximum Margin Classifier</strong>.</p></li></dd>
        <dd><li><p>SVM has been used in real life applications such as Text Classification, Face detection, Handwriting recognition, Image classification, etc.</p></li></dd>

  <!--What could be done in the future-->
  <p>And in the next 10 years here is some research that likely to be done:</p>
<ol>
  <dl>
  <dd><li>Predicting disaster</li></dd>
  <dd><p>According to “Seismicity analysis and machine learning models for short-term low magnitude seismic activity predictions in Cyprus”, there are 3 techniques which are Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks. They are used for training to develop the data model to predict future earthquake</p></dd>
  <dd><li>Security in home</li></dd>
    <dd><p>Face detection with the family members of the owner and alert if there are strange people from the training data. According to Wikipedia, the algorithms have been applied in this method are eigenfaces, linear discriminant analysis, elastic bunch graph matching using the Fisherface algorithm, the hidden Markov model, the multilinear subspace learning using tensor representation, and the neuronal motivated dynamic link matching.</p></dd>
    <dd><p>Sound analysis to know if there is a window breaking, foot step from the outsiders. The algorithms applied in this is Neural Network according to “Deep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition: The Shared Views of Four Research Groups”</p></dd>
  <dd><li>Improving higher level of Quantum Computing</li></dd>
    <dd><p>According to Scarlett Rose in the written article “What is the Future of Machine Learning?”, by applying the quantum machine learning algorithms, the quantum computer will make the process of data go faster. As a result of it, this can help to extend the analysis’s ability and give a clear understanding from data sets. This invention will help the business gain more positive outcome than the normal machine learning techniques.</p></dd>

    <!--What is the likely impact? (300 words) ​What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?-->
    <p>The potential impact of machine learning on 4 different area:</p>
    <dl class="potential-impacts">
      <ol>
        <!--Business-->
        <dd><li>Business:</li></dd>
        <dd><p>- Marketing Automation : According to "3 Ways to Automate Marketing with Machine Learning" by TopBots, machine learning will be used to identify target customers and help the company have the insight view which customers will be impacted on which methods : email, Facebook ads, etc. As a result of that, they will deliver a more specific user experience. There are many techniques that can be applied in this field such as one to one matching, prediction model, a/b testing, multi arm bandit, etc. Although this method is not applied much in the business, it will be a necessary tool for those who work in marketing since it will boost their productivity by those methods I have shown.</p></dd>
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2yDc6MRIiiFQMdi-I_Mq1aK-As7gcJyrIpQufViDhqTDy90XrpX-PTlBEhZkKBWtO8XGtH5IxlUQQUMTOGBn-vLMvouuXQZNVIjffvjVzumypAB25JvkNuHRtMoSkGbOmsrxoLvj" alt="potential-impacts-on-dif-areas">
        <dd><p>- Recruitment : The company called Textio has applied machine learning in job’s advertisements to analyze the pattern of language to attract more candidates. Another way that machine learning has changed this field is that CV- Screening. In one day, the company can receive more than 100 resumes and CV. This will be time consuming for the HR to read an amount of CV like that. Therefore, according to Ideal, there are 3 tools that apply machine learning to help the headhunters save time by finding the keywords, traits and qualities written in their CV that are necessary for the job based on the given requirement.</p></dd>
        <!--Healthcare-->
        <dd><li>Healthcare:</li></dd>
        <img src="Images\healthcare.jpg" width=750 height=380 alt="dif-areas">
        <dd><p>- According to “The Potential Impact of Machine Learning in Healthcare” by rx4Group, machine learning can make the diagnosis be more quicker, more reliable and more accessible by using deep learning and image recognition. An example of this can be the approach that uses machine learning, analysis prediction and pattern recognition to obtain accuracy for 89 percent, more than doctor which is 73 percent in diagnosing breast cancer according to “Google computers trained to detect breast cancer” by the Mercury News. This kind of tool will mostly affect those who work in the hospital and the patient. For the doctors' side, this tool can help them to increase the accuracy in diagnosing the illness by the techniques I have shown below. For the patient's side, according to “How America’s 5 Top Hospitals are Using Machine Learning Today” by Kumba Sennaar, machine learning can predict the patient's condition to prevent the emergency situation from occurring. Moreover, by using real time data collecting, it also tracks the patient's health status.</p></dd>
        <!--Logistics-->
        <dd><li>Logistics:</li></dd>
        <img src="Images\logistics.jpg" width=750 height=380 alt="dif-areas">
        <dd><p>- According to “How Machine Learning Impacts Manufacturing and Logistics” by Nick Ostdick, machine learning will help companies produce higher quality products with longer life spans. It can pinpoint potential faults, failures or defects during development in real time. State tracking also allows planners and administrators to have forecasting accuracy. It helps reduce the freight cost during the process.</p></dd>
        <!--Transportation-->
        <dd><li>Transportation:</li></dd>
        <img src="Images\transportation.jpg" width=750 height=380 alt="dif-areas">
        <dd><p>- Although the technology in self-driving cars is still not perfect, it still has the potential impact in the future. According to “15 ways Machine learning will impact your daily life” by Elite Data Science, the uses of machine learning help the car to continuously change the road condition, while learning a new road situation at the same time. Therefore, the decisions made will be faster than the well trained driver. Self driving car will make the road safer and prevent injuries. Moreover, this can boost our productivity by searching for the fastest way to go to the destination or helping us to find the parking car easier. As a result of it, it will cut down our fuel consumption which will save us a lot of money. The most people who will be affected by this technology could be drivers. Customers can not put their trust on the whom they just meet at the moment since many crimes have occurred on this vehicle. Therefore, if the self-driving are legally permitted to ride on the road, they may switch to use it and the numbers of drivers will be cut down which leads to unemployment.</p></dd>
      </ol>
    </dl>
    <p>As a result of what I have shown, machine learning is a tool to revolutionize industrial technology since it makes all the works more efficient, more accurate and more accessible. Although machine learning is efficient and creates the bigger change in the manufacture , it will not replace an entire career. Machine learning just can do some of the tasks required in a job. According to “What machine learning can do and can not do ?” by Irving Wladawsky-Berger, just some of the tasks in the occupation are suitable for using machine learning, while others require social skills, judgement and other human capabilities. </p>
    <!--How will this affect you? (300 words) ​In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?-->
    <dl class="affection">
      <ul>
        <dt><strong><ins>How will this affect you ?</ins></strong></dt>
        <dd><li><p>In my daily life, machine learning has a huge impact on me. Firstly, virtual personal assistant which is applied speech recognition, converting text to speech or speech to text and  Natural Language Processing is a must-have tool in your life since it helps me, my family and my friends reduce the time of doing tasks and it also is a great help for someone who is lack of capability such as illiteracy or disability. My dad frequently calls his co-workers when he drives the car which is not safe if he was driving the car at the same time as picking up the phone. Therefore, with the great help of Siri, he just has to say “Hey siri, call Tom” and the virtual assistant then looks in the contact data and makes the phone call. Another example is my grandmother, because of her ability, it is very difficult for her to use the phone to call somebody. However, with the slice of speech, she now can easily call my family without taking time to find where the phone icon is. Secondly, Google Translate, this application is applied to machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Process, POS Tagging, Chunking and NER and nobody can deny the greatest benefits that it brings to us. I use Google Translate as it is my daily routine, from translating it to read books to learning how to pronounce the word. This helps me a lot since it is not time consuming and it is free. Back in the days I did not discover this great tool, I bought a dictionary which just contained one language and it did not support the pronunciation. Moreover, when I want to look up the word, I have to search it in the alphabet order which takes me a lot of time to do so. However, compared to Google Translate, I can learn whatever language I want to, learn how to speak easily and search words very fast. My family uses mainly this for work such as translating the contract and speaking to foreigners. Overall, there are more applications using machine learning that affect us in different aspects.</p></li></dd>
        <dd><li><p>In the future,  with the help of machine learning in self-driving cars, I don’t have to remember which ways to go to my wanted destination. Instead of that, I just have to enter the location I want to go and sleep until it reaches the destination. Moreover, it will help my father a lot since he has to work anywhere, anytime especially on the car. He has to make contact with his co-worker while driving the car which is not safe. However, with the help of self - driving cars, my father can work in the car and also guarantee safety. </p></li></dd>

    <!--What does it do? (600 words) ​What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?-->
        <li1><strong>What does it do ?</strong></li1><br>

        <p>The term ‘Blockchain’ - [1]“is a decentralized transaction and data management technology developed first for Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The interest in Blockchain technology has been increasing since the idea was coined in 2008. The reason for the interest in Blockchain is its central attributes that provide security, anonymity and data integrity without any third party organization in control of the transactions, and therefore it creates interesting research areas, especially from the perspective of technical challenges and limitations”. Therefore, currency transactions are often controlled and centralized by third party organizations. Thus, currency transfers and digital payments require intermediaries such as banks or credit cards to make transactions. Additionally, a fee is caused when making a transaction from these intermediaries. This process also applied in some domains namely Games, Music, Software and more. Rather than allowing two principal entities whose making transaction to control their data and information, in fact this was in charge by the third party. To solve this issue, blockchain technology has been developed. The purpose of blockchain technology is creating a decentralized environment where there are no third parties involved.
</p>

      <p>Therefore, the application of blockchain technology has been applied in many fields, especially for those that have historically relied on third parties. The state of art of blockchain technology is EOS, a new blockchain protocol. According to EOS creator Dan Larimer, the purpose of this new development is to provide a secure and transparent system. Furthermore, EOS also offers a management system for both local and global monetary transactions. Moreover, EOS is actually a decentralized platform, its main purpose is to develop and support the ability to build decentralized applications.

      <li1><strong>What can be done now ?</strong></li1>

      <p>At the moment, blockchain technology was only used for financial and non-financial purposes. Applications of blockchain were divided into two sections - financial and non-financial. I will list down some applications for each sections:
</p>
    <dl>

      <dt><p>For financial applications:</p></dt>

      <p>- Cryptocurrencies: digital currency using cryptography to manage and secure transactions. By using blockchain technology, cryptocurrency cannot be copy and hacked, the owner can avoid these properties being stolen.
</p>

      <dd><li><p>For example: Bitcoin, Litecoin, EOS.IO,...</p></li></dd>

    <p>- Insurance: such as insurers properties might be registered by using blockchain technology, the insurers then can check the transaction history.
</p>

      <dd><li><p>For example: Everledger,...</p></li></dd>

      <dt><p>For non-financial applications:</p></dt>

      <p>- Musics industry: determining music royalties and managing music rights ownership.
</p>

      <dd><li><p>For example: Imogen Heap, a British singer sells her songs using the blockchain</p></li></dd>

      <p>- Decentralized proof of documents existence: storing and validating the timestamp and signature of a document using blockchain.</p>

      <dd><li><p>For examples: www.proofofexistence.com website's purpose is to store your documents. POEX.IO or Proof of Existence provides anonymity, privacy and decentralized proof which allow your uploaded documents cannot be erased or modified by anyone, even the third parties. You can publicly upload your documents online, but other people cannot copy your works or change the owner's name or the published time.</p></li></dd>

      <p>- Decentralized storage: sharing documents without third parties to involve by using peer-to-peer distributed cloud storage platform.</p>

      <dd><li><p>For example: Storj.com, Storj is an end-to-end cloud storage platform which uses cryptography to secure your files. Additionally, your files are then encrypted, break into ‘pieces’ and then stored in decentralized networks and servers which only you can have access to your files. Therefore, Storj provides you a token which is similar to cryptocurrency, the main function of this token is you can use the token to buy more storage. Furthermore, people who lack storage can rent you at the cost of this token.</p></li></dd>

    <li1><strong>What will be done in the future ?</strong></li1>

    <p>Although there were just a few areas that apply blockchain technology, in the future there will be an expansion on using blockchain technology. I will list down some area that might and will be using blockchain technology in their applications:</p>

    <dd><li><p>Using blockchain technology for healthcare purposes:</p></li></dd>

    <img src="https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Blockchain-Technology-in-Healthcare-Market.png" alt="healthcare image">

    <p>Blockchain technology is considered as a virtually incorruptible database. Therefore, using blockchain technology could reduce the medical costs, secure the information about critical health issues in the world, secure the patients data and medical sensitive data. Additionally, blockchain is treated as a distributed ledger to store healthcare or related data for exchanging, sharing, analyzing, recording and validating among stakeholders [2]. Furthermore, beside healthcare applications, the Health Information Exchange or healthcare transactions between patients, providers, and other relevant parties is also the most discussed. These recorded data are described in the Improved medical record management, Enhanced insurance claim process, and Accelerated clinical/biomedical research sections.[3]</p>

    <dd><li><p>Intelligent vehicles:</p></li></dd>

    <img src="https://eenews.cdnartwhere.eu/sites/default/files/styles/inner_article/public/sites/default/files/images/2018-10-10-jh-mobi.jpg?itok=cx1bV9lg" alt="intelligent vehicles images">

    <p>Intelligent Vehicles (IV) or simply known as self-driving transportations. These transportation use ad-hoc networks for vehicle communication which namely Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), Wireless Access Vehicular Environment (WACE), and cellular network. Therefore, these ad-hoc networks do not guarantee a secure data transmission.[3] In fact, the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is based on cellular and IT standards mechanisms, which therefore are not up-to-date and can be harmful for the system.</p>

    <p>In the future, these IVs will be fully autonomous, by using dynamic blockchain (LDB) and main blockchain, enabled with a secure and unique crypto ID called intelligent vehicle trust point (IVTP). The IVTP provides trustworthiness among vehicles. Vehicles then use and verify the IVTP with the LDB to communicate with other vehicles.[4]</p>

    <p>The supply chain is a complex process of distribution and creation of goods. Depending on the types of the product, the supply chain can contain many phases, multiple geographical locations, several individuals, entities, accounts and payments, and means of transport. By applying blockchain technology in the supply chain processes could improve its sustainability. Blockchain can enhance the efficiency and transparency of the supply chain and affects all supply processes, delivery and payments. In addition, tracking goods through blockchain can improve the decision-making process with the end result being a more satisfying service for the end user.[5]</p>

<!--What is the likely impact? (300 words) ​What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?-->
    <li1><strong><p>What is the likely impact ?</p></strong></li1>

    <p>Blockchain technology nowadays has been used more frequently by many companies and areas. The most potential impact of blockchain is data storage and management. Therefore, the original recorded data were publicly online so people can read, observe and even change it. When the recorded data has been changed through several processes, it becomes unreliable. Some data even was stolen and re-edited with a different owner. By using blockchain technology, the data then is decentralized and secure. The owner can stamp their published date and name on a block in a blockchains, in addition, the data when uploaded to a block are being decentralized and cannot be changed or copied. Therefore, the most affected people are the stakeholders, companies or any organizations because it will change the way they are used to store and protect the data. This development will not replace, create or make redundant any of the current jobs. The only thing that will change is the technologies used to store the data and software that provides protection to these data.</p>

<!--How will this affect you? (300 words) ​In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?-->
    <li1><strong>How will this affect you ?</strong></li1>

    <p>In the future, this development will be an efficient way for me, my family and friends to protect my data, which prevents plagiarism, avoiding my data being stolen and changed. Especially when doing a project, by integrating my name, establishing a date, project information on the blockchain, I will avoid others copied my works and make it become their.  This development also affects the way we stored data, instead of saving them in the folders on a laptop or PC, we can upload them in a block on chains of blocks, by decentralizing our data, our works cannot be hacked. Seeing our data being secured, the less nervous we are.</p>

    <h3><strong><ins>Cryptocurrency</ins></strong></h3>
    <!--Cryptocurrency-->
    <p>Cryptocurrency is a type of currency that has been encrypted with a function similar to physical money but it instead exists in digital form. Unlike physical money, which is used in real life, cryptocurrency is usually used for transferring purposes, bought or sold items between parties over the Internet and its values were determined by the market. Cryptocurrency also can be used to purchase products or services, along with making payments to other things on the Internet. The current state of the art of cryptocurrency is EOS.IO, a modern cryptocurrency which was introduced in 2017. </p>

    <li1><strong>What does it do ?</strong></li1><br>

    <p>At the present, the only application of cryptocurrency is for financial purposes such as mediums of exchange.
For mediums of exchange purposes: some cryptocurrencies such as EOS.IO, Etherium or Bitcoin were used for purchasing and paying for commodities. Unlike physical money whose value can be copied by using unauthentic materials, cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to decentralize, the monetary value then be encrypted. By using decentralized technology, the recorded transactions between two principle entities then being secured, cryptocurrencies therefore cannot be hacked or copied. When making a purchase, the tokens or coins that need to buy the items will be valued by the market.

    <p>In the future, the application of cryptocurrency will expand continuously not only for exchanging commodities but beyond that. I will down some possibility:</p>

    <dd><li><p>Biomedical/Healthcare:</p></li></dd>

    <img src="https://mhealthintelligence.com/images/site/features/2016-09-29-healthcare-kiosk.png" alt="biomedical/healthcare images">

    <p>Therefore in the future, healthcare will be using blockchain technology to store and secure data. Being decentralized, cryptocurrency can then be applied in medical areas such as for paying medical bills and medicines. The recorded transactions, and personal information like medical form can only be seen by the customers.</p>

    <dd><li><p>Alternate currency system:</p></li></dd>

    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*a_UJgbQfGI0pEnP0BOxcNg.png"  width=900 height=450 alt="currency images">

    <p>In the future, cryptocurrencies will replace the currencies system in the world. Creating a new virtual monetary credit which is decentralized and secure. This results on the impact of cryptocurrency to the world.</p>
    <!--What is the likely impact? (300 words) ​What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?-->
    <li1><strong>What is the likely impact ?</strong></li1>

    <p>With a stable development, cryptocurrency would be a revolution in economics all over the world, as well as the marketplace. The result of this is because cryptocurrency is a type of currency made from immaterial from the digital world which has been encrypted by blockchain technology. As we have known, every country has their own currencies, and if another type of currency exists in their systems, there will be an economic crisis. So that is why economics is the most potential impact of cryptocurrency. Therefore, if we want to avoid an economic crisis, the new cryptocurrency must be acknowledged worldwide and be used for exchange purposes. Besides potential impact, cryptocurrency can replace the term “Type of currency”. If a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin was used widely by all society, there will be a high chance that the current currency will be replaced completely, making it become the only currency that exists.
With the rise of cryptocurrency, the type of person that easily gets attracted to this digital money is investors, especially young investors, or middle age. Unlike senior one, these two types usually seek for potential things that are worth investing in and cryptocurrency is one of them. The developing stage of cryptocurrency is significantly high, the money you get compared to the first time you invest in will be doubled or sometimes tripled if that cryptocurrency is successful in attracting people. For example, 1 Bitcoin now worth 266,509,023 VND. With that huge amount of money, no investor could resist it, especially for young people who are seeking for success.
Furthermore, if cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin become a new currency unit in the world, the first thing will be replaced and wiped out is money-printing machine, and materials such as polymer and wood would no longer be needed for printing out the currency. With the extinction of the money-printing machine, therefore the person who is in charge of this machine will also be fired. Instead, people who have graduated Computer Science and received it qualification will be recruited, because cryptocurrency like Bitcoin can not be achieved freely but instead you have to solve encrypted puzzles provided by Bitcoin software in order to achieve those coins. This process needs a lot of electricity and technical expertise.

  <li1><strong>How will this affect you ?</strong></li1>

  <p>Although cryptocurrency is developing constantly, there are still no crucial impacts of this digital money on our daily life now. This result in many countries is still underdeveloped, and many of them have not got access to the term ‘Cryptocurrency’ yet. For my daily life, physical currency is still the typical currency which is used day by day, people still use physical currency to exchange, sell and buy things and as time goes by, it has become a part of our life, the most thing we get used to. But in the future, things might go different as cryptocurrency would replace the entire currency system. Therefore, we usually bring with us a wallet and phone, but in the future the only thing you brought with us is just your phone or a crypto card for payments purposes. There will be no longer thieves that stole your belongings and if they do, they must encrypt your card to use your money, but that for the future. Furthermore, I do not need to go to the supermarket, mega mall or grocery stores to buy things, instead what I need is to lay back on the couch and press a button, all the items will be paid and ready to deliver. Life would be more modern, easier, and simpler for me. For young people like myself and my friends, it would be less difficult for us to get familiar with the term ‘cryptocurrency’, though we might see each other often and discuss it together, but for the elders and my parents it will be more difficult from knowing “what is it ?” to “how to use it efficiently”. Moreover, because they have been using physical currency for a long time, it will take time to explain for them and sometimes a family member will not know how to use electric devices as well.</p>

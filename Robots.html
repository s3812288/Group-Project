            <p>The state of art of this new technology is humanoid robots. According to Wikipedia, a humanoid robot is a robot having the body shape that looks like a human body. The purpose of using this robot is to interact with human tools or environment, explore space, be a personal assistant, search, rescue people,etc. The most advanced humanoid robot to mention might be Sophia - the first artificial intelligent robots that was developed by Hanson Robotics.</p>

            <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Group Project\GroupImages\RobotsImages\robots5.png" alt="robots_images">
            <dd><p>According to “DaNang online”, during the out-break of COVID pandemic, a small group of students in Ho Chi Minh City has developed a robot that can deliver things automatically to reduce the interaction between people which means it can decrease the spreading of coronavirus. The main functions of these robots is to sterilize, deliver food, medicine from outside to patients’ rooms.</p></dd>
            <dd><li>Exploitation</li></dd>
            <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Group Project\GroupImages\RobotsImages\robots8.png" alt="robots_images">
            <dd><p>- According to Nasa, they have currently sent four robots called Rovers to Mars. These robots with the specialized wheels help the scientists to identify what parts of the planet is made of since Mars is made of various kinds of rocks and in each rock, there is a combination of chemicals. </p></dd>

          <dd><p>- According to “How Medical Robots Will Help Treat Patients in Future Outbreaks” by Kris Hauser and Ryan Shaw, they predict in the future the healthcare industry will have the participation of robotics and telemedicine called tele-nuring. Tele-nursing is an idea that nurses control the robot to do tasks relative to patient care since it reduces the rate of getting infected and improves social distancing. </p></dd>
          <dd><li>Robots as co-workers</li></dd>
          <dd><p>- In the future, robots might take multiple roles in the companies such as scheduling the meeting, sending the document to the specific people, etc just by giving the command. According to Nikolas Badminton, the futurist expected the workplace to developed in this way:  “You’re probably going to walk into an office and your system’s been churning over the last couple of hours considering what’s been going on in business, your role, your job, what you need to do that day, and probably offer up several ideas about the right direction of what to do” <strong>(need to paraphrase or do something to not cause plagiarism)</strong></p></dd>

        <dl class=2nd_question"">
          <dt><strong><ins>What is the likely impacts ?</ins></strong></dt>
          <br>
          <dt>In education</dt>
          <dd><li><p>Robot can be a teacher or a peer learner since the teachers can not have capability to monitor and provide enough careness for all the students. Therefore, with the help of robots, the student will meet the necessary requirement of personalized learning. </p></li></dd>
          <dd><li><p>The most affected group of people are young people especially toddlers. According to the research “Sociable robot improves toddler vocabulary skills” conducted in 2009, the use of robots in the classroom had significantly improved vocabulary skills of 18-24 months toddlers. </p></li></dd>
          <dd><li><p>Robot in education is not replacing the teacher since robots don’t have any social skills and other human’s capabilities such as empathy, judgement, etc.</p></li></dd>
          <br>
          <dt>At home</dt>
          <dd><li><p>Home security robot: Robots can guard your home while you are away by detecting faces, recognizing suspicious sounds and alerting the owners if there is an intruder. Another company called “Deep Sentinel” has been taking this field to the next level by developing a security robot that can predict and prevent crime from occurring. It will immediately alert the owner in real time and contact to the police right away <strong>(in the website should include the video)</strong><p></li></dd>
          <dd><li><p>Domestic robot: Besides being the security guard, robots can help us to do the housework which saves us a lot of time. We can set the time to the vacuum cleaner to clean the house before we get home. Moreover, according to “The World's First Home Robotic Chef Can Cook Over 100 Meals” by Eustacia Huen, robots can help us cook the meal faster based on the recipes downloading on the internet and then clean up after itself too.</p></li></dd>
          <dd><li><p>Robot guarding at home is mostly affecting the house owner since it keeps not only their home but also their family members safe. The robot also helps the police reduce the number of crimes and prevent painful accidents. Although this can boost our productivity, it can not replace the security guard or the police officer since the robots just can be in charge of the dull and repetitive duty while humans can do the complex, stimulating tasks.</p></li></dd>
          <dd><li><p>About the domestic robot, the most affected people might be the busy person since it helps to keep the house clean and helps them to stay healthy by preventing them from eating outside. Domestic robot such as a cooking robot can not replace chefs since creating dishes needs creativity and robots can do that, it just can follow the instructions of the recipe. However, in the future, with the numbers of using domestic robots, there will be redundancy in the normal cleaning vacuum, washing machine, ironing, cookers, etc since the multi-function robots contain all of those in one machine.</p></li></dd>

      <!--How will this affect you? (300 words) ​In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?-->
      <dl class="3rd_question">
        <dt><strong><ins><p>How will this affects you ?</p></ins></strong></dt>
        <dd><p>In the future, life will be more advanced compared to the main time, and the most vital thing that took part in this revolution is robotics, and things that had the most impact are humans which include our friends, family and ourselves. In fact, our lives now have been depending on robots a lot. First of all, the thing that must be discussed is our daily life or mundane activities at home. For example, we used to walk around the house with a vacuum cleaner, and that action is really exhausting especially for women.</p></dd>
        <dd><p>Therefore, a vacuum robot has been created which oversees cleaning the house surface, it can be manipulated by far with an application from the phone. In the future, our reliance on the robots will be unchangeable, this resulted in working away from home. You will not have to worry about the hygiene in your house, this term will be completely accomplished by the household chores robots. Furthermore, shopping will be easier for us, this resulted in delivering products to our house with a drone.</p></dd>
        <dd><p>Moreover, we usually go shopping with our friends or with family, sharing things and discussing together. But in the future, there is no such a thing, and it will be difficult for us to adapt, especially for the young generations. People in the late generations – which have more difficulty in adapting to the new things because they have been interacting with the current world for a long time. Unlike the old generations, the younger generations seem adapting to those change much easier, this results in the curiosity they have. Young people always want to try things that are new and strange, in fact they are addicted to it, willing to test it and share it with others. For middle-aged people or above, the term robot is such a whole new thing to them, but for young generations like us is more like absorbing new knowledge.</p></dd>

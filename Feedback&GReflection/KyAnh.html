          <dd><li>Advantages: The only advantage that I possess is persistence. Although my coding skill is not the best, but I am always enhancing my skill overtime. When I am facing a problem from coding such as making a website or practicing with Python, I often find a solution by myself or observing solutions from any IT forums.</li></dd>
          <br>
          <dd><li>Disadvantages: Although I am only studying this course for a few months, therefore I have not participated in any complementary courses from outside. In facts, my coding skill is not as strong as other peoples. When coding for our group website, is just a simple page with pictures and words in it. Furthermore, I lack in communication skill. When I confront any problems in coding the website, I do not ask my team members for help or any advice which makes it difficult for me to code.</li></dd>

          <dt>Quynh Ngo (s3836322)</dt>
          <br>
          <dd><li>Advantages: Quynh coding skill was good; we can see her potential when looking at her website. Furthermore, she always encourages others team member to push them forward. Despite that our team only contains 3 members, Quynh can providing each task for each member separately and equally, so that there will be no conflicts between teammates. Nevertheless, Quynh always willing to help other members regards what the tasks is, she also the person who gives me advices on my coding skill, she taught me how to make the coding sections more readable by providing comments so that when peoples inspects my code their can navigate each sections easier. Quynh writing skill is amazing, she can express and give a clear definition when writing, it can be easily seen by looking at her project ideas. The functions and features were described very detail.</li></dd>
          <br>
          <dd><li>Disadvantages:  Although Quynh navigation skill and her writing skill is beyond expectation, the only weakness is she lack in communication. Within teammates there is no problem, but when asking questions with other peoples she cannot express the main points of the questions, this resulted in the answers were not good as expected.</li></dd>

He provides questions that ask directly to the main point and the answers we received were valuable. Furthermore, Tuan report also very credible and all the sources were reliable. He also uses a lot of academic words which makes his report look very professional.  Nevertheless, each sections of Tuan report fulfill all the requirements of the questions.</li></dd>

        <dd><p>The first time I worked in a group was not as good as I expected, each member including me have different characteristics. Therefore, this differentiate was a challenge for us, if we cannot know each other’s well, then we do not know how to provide suitable task for each person. However, after working together for 3 weeks, we have known each other’s and turns out everything were beyond my expectation. We scheduled the plan and choose time for meeting; therefore, we have 4 meeting in total. </p></dd>
        <dd><p>After clarifying each other firmly, we then start the first meeting. The first one is presenting team members projects idea and ideal jobs, then we start to hand out each task for each person in the group, by providing suitable task for each member, the last three meeting were going on well without occur any problems. Rather than a group of 4 like other groups, our group only contains up to 3 members, so this resulted in each of us have more work to do before the deadline.</p></dd>
        <dd><p>At first, I thought that this is too much work but with Quynh helps, she has providing suitable task for each person according to everyone strength, so this was going well after that. Furthermore, Quynh and I were designer for our website; therefore, my coding skill is only for beginners but Quynh has helped me a lot in this area and I have acquired more knowledge in coding. Therefore, I need to improve my coding skill and knowledge so I can help my team member a lot more.</p></dd>

      <dl class="group_reflections">
        <dd><p>In overall, the TAQ team at the beginning confront many difficulties. With the differentiate in characteristics of each member; therefore, they cannot provide a suitable task for them. However, things have moving in a positive way.</p></dd>
        <dd><p>The first meeting has been scheduled, the purposes of this meeting is to introduce each member project ideas and ideal jobs. After this first meeting, each person chooses a topic of their own and searching for sources before start to work on it. After choosing topics, the team leader – Tuan has creating a share drive so each member can contribute their task separately in the folder. Each member contributed their works orderly which namely Team Profile – in Team Profile section, the TAQ team must share their 3-learning style test and their ideal jobs. This process could help member in the group known each other more clearly.</p></dd>
        <dd><p>The second section has been replaced with Industry Data because the Tools section is related to interviewing, so it has been done later. In Industry Data, each member in individual must provide their Top Generic Skills, Top IT Skills, and Top Job Titles and named what rank they were. This section was a bit difficult because some of the team member skill does not ranked in the Burning Glass Data or the skills name were different. This problem has been easily solved by searching for they own skills or jobs accordingly to the provided data. </p></dd>
        <dd><p>After finishing the first section and second section, the TAQ team begins to work on the IT Technologies section. Although the team lack in the number of team member, each person has decided to choose one of their own topics as they had pick before and after finishing the selected topics, the members then will choose the fourth one and working on it together. The TAQ team has confronting many difficulties on this section. </p></dd>
        <dd><p>Some of the chosen topic was very hard to find a source with high credibility, there for one of the members do not know how to find a trustworthy source before but the others have helped to solve this issue. Because the time spent on finding the source was enormous, it took half of the week to complete finding sources and start to write a report. Therefore, a member in the team has some personal problem and cannot complete the section to the date. The team has confirmed that this cannot be done before the deadline, however every team member of TAQ team has try their best and completed all the section perfectly. </p></dd>
        <dd><p>For the Tools or interview section, Tuan with his amazing communication skill has set up a meeting with some IT professional and start to interview them, he had given out the questions which asked directly to the main point so the information that TAQ team gathered was beyond their expectation. </p></dd>
        <dd><p>Furthermore, after completing all the sections above, the team has enacted a meeting for Project Ideas section. Each member introducing their own ideas, then they contrast it before choosing which ideas will be chosen. All the ideas were perfects to select, but the ideas of Tuan were hard to be deployed and Ky Anh projects was an application on phone so therefore, they do not acquire any skill to make an app. The TAQ team has make a final decision and the chosen one was Quynh project idea, which is an online learning website. </p></dd>
        <dd><p>The Feedback and Group Reflection section was done perfectly by each member in the team and there is no issue in it. For creating the group website, Quynh is the person who in charge of giving other member a suitable section for them to code. After finishing the coding for each section, the member will then push it to Github and share the code to other. By giving each person a section to code instead of one person handle the coding section, this action can make sure that each member has contributed to the log of activities.</p></dd>

          <br>
          <dd><li>Advantages: When I worked as a member of the group, I always tried my best on everythings such as design web which you can see my effort when you look in our group website. The website was not perfect but I will try to improve my skills in the near future. About my work in writing the assessment, I followed most of the requirements section. Moreover, when the deadline was set for a different task, I did it on time. </li></dd>
          <dd><li>Disadvantages: I think I lack communication skills since when I wanted to ask some questions in the interview, I could not express that. As a result of it, we missed communication and received a question that was not as I expected. Moreover, I am bad at writing reports so this is what I need to improve since when I write these feedback on myself, it takes me two days just to write all these lines. As a result of it, my report did not include many academic words which made my report less professional. </li></dd>

          <dt>Giang Ky Anh (s3812288)</dt>
          <br>
          <dd><li>Adavantages: When I work with him, I am quite impressed by his web developed skills since I have learned a lot of new things when I looked into his code. For example, I have learned “<strong>ins</strong>” to underline the work or “<strong>dl</strong>”  to define the description list and also his code looks very clean with a lot of comments. Therefore, when we combined our code together, I could understand his code . Moreover, when I read his report about the blockchain, I can have an insight view about it since besides giving the definition, he also gave many reality examples and many pictures to demonstrate his view. His structure to perform the report looks clean, easy to read and includes all the requirements. Besides the assessment, I think he is working well in the group and has good communication skills toward the member.</li></dd>

          <dd><li>Disadvantage : Hard to point out what is wrong in his work.</li></dd>

          <dt>Nguyen Thanh Tuan (s3836455)</dt>
          <br>
          <dd><li>Advantage : Firstly, he has the greatest skills in communication in our group. Thanks to him, the interview occurred well and all the information we received was valuable. Moreover, I was very impressed when I read his report, all the information given was detailed and the sources he found were reliable. The report looks clean, professional since it includes a lot of academic words that I have to do some research to understand his point of view. Moreover, the report follows most of the requirements. Furthermore, the code is written clean and included a lot of comments so it makes his code readable. He also is the one who advised me to write the code more efficiently and not waste much memory. </li></dd>
          <br>
          <dd><li>Disadvantage : It is hard to find his disadvantage in his assessment and his attitude toward the group.</li></dd>

      <h2>Quynh Reflection</h2>
      <dl class="Reflection">
        <dd>My perception of the group</dd>
        <dd><p>When I first worked in the group, everything was a bit difficult since each person has a different characteristic so we have difficulty in understanding each other's thoughts and perspectives. However, having worked with each other for 3 weeks, turns out everything is great, we know which people are suitable for the task so each member can use their strength to do the task well. For example, I have difficulty in having conversations with other people. Therefore, Tuan or Ky Anh can do the interview section and give me the task that can show my strength. Even everything seems great, one of the things that our teams need to improve is not procrastination. Up to the day of the deadline, not all of us could do it on time so we currently had to move the deadline to the next day. Fortunately, every work was done perfectly on the new setting date (thanks god). During our cooperation, there are several things that surprised me which is the mysterious power to do the report. One of our members, apologizing that I can not mention the name since it would cause him a lot of trouble, had done the report more than 5000 words within a day before the deadline. I am quite impressed because for me, to write the report for more than 5000 words, it takes me 6 days to plan an idea, find a source and write it on my own word. Meeting each other, I have learned a lot of things, especially soft skills for example how to do the report within a day or how to find source and information in effective ways. This is an important skill since when I google, I meet a lot of sources and not know how to classify it, with the help of my teammates when google, I not only save time in finding information but also finding the source that is reliable using google scholar. </p></dd>
